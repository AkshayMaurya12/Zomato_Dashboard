🍽️ Zomato Order Analytics Dashboard – Power BI
This Power BI project is a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that visualizes insights from a fictional Zomato food order dataset. The purpose of the project is to simulate real-world restaurant analytics and customer behavior to understand how data can drive strategic decisions in the online food delivery ecosystem.

It is structured into three distinct pages, each focusing on a specific aspect of the business: overall national insights, restaurant-level performance, and delivery metrics.

🎯 Project Objective
With the rapid growth of food delivery platforms, businesses like Zomato need strong analytics to make informed decisions. This dashboard mimics that scenario by answering key business questions such as:

📍 Which states or regions generate the highest food delivery revenue?

🏆 Which restaurant chains are most popular and profitable?

⏱️ How efficient is the delivery system across different distances and locations?

💳 What are the most preferred payment modes by customers?

🍽️ How do ratings, cost, and tipping behavior vary across cities and states?

By answering these, the dashboard helps simulate how stakeholders—restaurant owners, marketers, logistics teams, and executives—can use data to improve their operations and customer experience.
